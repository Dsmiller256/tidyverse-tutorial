# tidyverse-tutorial

This is a `tidyverse` tutorial that I have used in many contexts, originally for the `data on the mind` workshop at Berkeley in 2017. 

# Original course blurb

The availability of data on the web has opened up many resources for cognitive scientists who know how to deal with "medium data" - big enough to crash excel but small enough to load into memory. R is a powerful tool for statistical data analysis and reproducible research, and the "tidverse" - an ecosystem of R packages for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data - provides many tools for manipulating this kind of data quickly and easily. In this tutorial, I'll walk through how to go from a database or tabular data file to an interactive plot with surprisingly little pain (and less code than you'd imagine). My focus will be on introducing a workflow that uses a wide variety of different tools and packages, including readr, dplyr, tidyr, and shiny. I'll assume basic familiarity with R and will use (but not spend too much time teaching) ggplot2. Featuring data from http://wordbank.stanford.edu
